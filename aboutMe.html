                <h2>A Bit More About Me</h2>
                <p>
                    Hailing from the vibrant city of Maastricht, my tech journey began not just with traditional learning but by getting my hands dirty. Whether it was the intricacies of soldering or the endless possibilities with 3D printing, I was there, immersed in the Maker Lab.

                <h3>My Journey</h3>
                <p>
                    My infatuation with technology didn't stop at a hobby. It took me to the University of Maastricht, where I'm presently mastering the nuances of Data Science and Artificial Intelligence. My experiences range from the world of microcontrollers, like STM32F4 and ESP32, to diving deep into programming languages like C++, Java, and Python.

                <h3>What I Do</h3>
                <p>
                    By day, I'm a dedicated Bachelor Student of DSAI at the University of Maastricht, diving deep into the vast realms of Data Science and AI. But when the sun sets, you'll often find me in the Maker Lab, working on a new project or exploring the latest in tech. And when I need a breather? I'm probably traveling or updating this very blog you're reading!
                </p>
            
                <h3>My Vision for the Future</h3>
                <p>
                    I envision a world where technology, with all its intricacies, becomes as common a language as English. Through this platform, I aim to demystify and simplify tech topics, making them not just accessible but truly engaging. After all, isn't technology meant to be fun?
